**Deliverables:-**

The project delivers a detailed EDA notebook and a Power BI dashboard highlighting key metrics such as revenue trends, regional performance, customer segments, and outliers.

**Tools Used:-**

The analysis was conducted using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) in Jupyter Notebook, and the final dashboard was built in Power BI.

**Outcome:-**

This analysis provides actionable insights for strategic decision-making, helping Acme Co. improve planning, manage risk, and support sustainable growth.
